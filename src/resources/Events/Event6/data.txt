Well, looks like you've finally arrived
I've been watching you and I already
know that I am no match....
You are very strong, but do you
realize what you have been doing?
Attacking my knights everywhere,
You've been acting no better than
a criminal, but it seems like you've
had a purpose, now what is it that
you need?
....
Oh? You think I am the one who has been
sending my knights to attack my people?
Why on Earth would I do that?
Please stop this foolishness and help me
find the real culprit behind this havoc
......
You do not trust your own king? Your eyes
tell me you will not believe me
Very will it looks like I have no choice
but to bring up my sword

Good job! Now lets hurry to the throne
room and see what else this corrupt king
has been doing!
Huh? What's with that look?
Don't tell me you actually believed that
old fart? Stop messing around let's go!
.
...
......
..........
You won't come will you?
...Your usefulness has come to and end...
What a shame.....
Yes everything that the king has said is
true, he has done nothing wrong
It was I that has been controlling knights
in order to infiltrate the castle and kill
the king to rule this kingdom!
All I had to do was take their "sol" until
they had none left, it was an easy task
I'm impressed with you however, you made it
this far and still managed to resist me,
Its a shame I was unable to make you my
puppet, however.....
I gained more than enough power from being
with you this entire time
BEHOLD MY ULTIMATE TRANSFORMATION

Well, what do you think?
Heh, it looks like you've seen a ghost!
Well it's been a fun adventure but I'm
afraid this is where it all ends
I'll make this quick and painful for you
This will truly be THE END

....H-how could this happen.......
......I-I was unstoppable, my power..
.was supposed to be unbeatable......
..................
..I see.......
So you were this strong this whole time
huh? At least this makes me feel less bad
about defeat.....
Perhaps in another universe, this would
have been my victory.....
Perhaps.....
