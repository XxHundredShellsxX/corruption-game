Halt! Who are you and what is your business?
.....
Oh? So you are here to stop the king you say?
What a laughable statement, I shall teach you
to respect your ruler child, no mercy will
be shown to those who oppose the king!

Hm, it seems my fellow guard has ran away...
No matter, if you can best him, it means you
may just prove a challenge
If you weren't trying to intrude, I may have
been trying to recruit you instead
For now, in the name of the king I fight thee!

Ho ho! Those knights went rushing out!
What a show, you, child are a gifted one
I have not seen such prowess in many years
Now what are you here for?
........
Oh... Well if you want to meet the king you
will have to beat the two wizards in the
left and right side of this very room
They have cast a spell that does not
allow anyone to enter any further
Good luck child!
Although not everything is as it seems..
One last thing, I offer you this almighty weapon
In exchange you must have the spirit equivalent
to 9000 moons, will you take this offer?
Beware that if you accept and come short
that you will have to pay a *very* dear price
Anyhow I will be off! Decide carefully..
Will you choose to take the ultimate weapon!?
