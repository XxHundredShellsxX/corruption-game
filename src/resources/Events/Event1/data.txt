Wow thanks so much for saving me!
That man was scary! he kept
beating up a bunch of folks
from the town back over there
He sure got what was coming to him
So, as thanks how about I tag along with you?
I'll help you out whenever I can
Also as a warning, when you run away from
enemies, you lose 500 sol
